Modern CMake Project Generator Gor C++
======================================

Quickstart
----------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/izvolov/mylib.git
cmake . -DNEW_PROJECT_NAME=Mylib -DOUTPUT_ROOT=path/to/output/directory
```

As a result of executing these commands, a project named "Mylib" will be created in the `path/to/output/directory` directory. The resulting project is a full-fledged CMake project, ready for use and modification.

Detailed instructions for using the generated project will be found in the project's README.
